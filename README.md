My global game jam repository for the year 2023

Core Concept
	The player finds themselves in the forest with only a flashlight at hand. They must traverse the forest and find the exit while avoiding waking up evil Tree Ents that will “kill” the player if they get too close to the player. The player will have to recover for a time if they are hit by a Tree Ent. Players that are “killed” by the Tree Ents just faint and respawn at the beginning of the last checkpoint they passed over.
