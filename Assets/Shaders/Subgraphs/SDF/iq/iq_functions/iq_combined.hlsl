// Almost Identity (I)
/*
Imagine you don't want to modify a signal unless it's drops to zero or close to it, in which case
you want to replace the value with a small possitive constant. Then, rather than clamping the value
and introduce a discontinuity, you can smoothly blend * the signal into the desired clipped value.
So, let m be the threshold (anything above m stays unchanged), and n the value things will take when
the signal is zero. Then, the following function does the soft clipping (in a cubic fashion):

// Almost Identity (II)
/*
A different way to achieve a near identity is through the square root of a biased square. I
saw this technique first in a shader by user "omeometo" in Shadertoy. This approach can
be a bit slower than the cubic above, depending on the hardware, but I find myself using
it a lot these days. While it has zero derivative, it has a non-zero second derivative, so
keep an eye in case it causes problems in your application.

An extra nice thing is that this function can be used, unaltered, as an smooth-abs()
function, which comes handy for symmetric funtions such as mirrored SDFs.

This is a near-identity function that maps the unit interval into itself. It is the cousin of
smoothstep(), in that it maps 0 to 0, 1 to 1, and has a 0 derivative at the origin, just like
smoothstep. However, instead of having a 0 derivative at 1, it has a derivative of 1 at
that point. It's equivalent to the Almost Identity above with n=0 and m=1. Since it's a
cubic just like smoothstep() it is very fast to evaluate:

If you use smoothstep for a velocity signal (say, you want to smoothly accelerate a
stationary object into constant velocity motion), you need to integrate smoothstep()
over time in order to get the actual position of value of the animation. The function
below is exactly that, the position of an object that accelerates with smoothstep.
Note it's derivative is never larger than 1, so no decelerations happen.

Impulses are great for triggering behaviours or making envelopes for music or

polynomials. Use k to control falloff of the function. For example, a quadratic can be
used, which peaks at x = sqrt(1/k).

Similar to the previous, but it allows for control on the width of attack (through the
parameter "k") and the release (parameter "f") independently. Also, the impulse releases
at a value of 1 instead of 0.

Chances are you found yourself doing smoothstep(c-w,c,x)-smoothstep(c,c+w,x) very

this cubicPulse() below is my new friend and will be yours too soon. Bonus - you can
also use it as a performant replacement for a gaussian.

A natural attenuation is an exponential of a linearly decaying quantity: yellow curve, exp(-x).
A gaussian, is an exponential of a quadratically decaying quantity: light green curve, exp(-x2).
You can generalize and keep increasing powers, and get a sharper and sharper s-shaped curves.
For really high values of n you can approximate a perfect step(). If you want such step to
transition at x=a, like in the graphs to the right, you can set k = a-nâ‹…ln 2.

Remapping the unit interval into the unit interval by expanding the sides and

gain() function. This was a common function in RSL tutorials (the Renderman Shading
Language). k=1 is the identity curve, k<1 produces the classic gain() shape, and k>1
produces "s" shaped curces. The curves are symmetric (and inverse) for k=a and k=1/a.

one either side of the curve, which comes handy when creating leaves, eyes, and many
other interesting shapes.

A phase shifted sinc curve can be useful if it starts at zero and ends at zero, for some
bouncing behaviors (suggested by Hubert-Jan). Give k different integer values to tweak
the amount of bounces. It peaks at 1.0, but that take negative values, which can make it
unusable in some applications.
